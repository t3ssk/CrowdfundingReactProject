# Crowdfunding website single page web app

This web app was made using design files from frontendmentor.com. I hooked it up with backend so now people can create account and make pretend donations which they then can also view. 

This was first project I did without following any tutorials and it made me learn a lot of things. 

## Stuff used: 
- React
- React Router Dom
- Formik
- Yup
- Redux
- Typescript
- CSS modules
- Firebase
